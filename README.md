# xray_CNN
CNN that determines whether a patient has a hip implant
This model output an accuracy of 96.5% on my propietary dataset of 1169 training images (split between two classes: /implant (#760) and /no_implant (#409) and 200 testing images (split between two classes: /implant (#100) and /no_implant (#100)).
this model should work quite well for binary classifcation machine learning problems.
